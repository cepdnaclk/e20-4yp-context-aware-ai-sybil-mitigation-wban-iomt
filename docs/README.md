## Abstract

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are a critical component of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), enabling continuous health monitoring through wearable and implanted medical sensors. Due to their resource-constrained nature and reliance on open wireless communication, WBANs are highly vulnerable to security threats. Among these threats, Sybil attacks pose a significant risk by allowing a single malicious node to impersonate multiple identities, leading to false medical data injection, network disruption, and compromised patient safety.

This project proposes a lightweight, context-aware, self-healing security framework for detecting and mitigating Sybil attacks in IoMT-based WBANs. The framework integrates cryptographic identity verification with context-aware machine learning techniques to improve detection accuracy while minimizing energy consumption and latency. Additionally, a self-healing mechanism is introduced to autonomously isolate compromised nodes, revoke security credentials, and restore network reliability. Experimental evaluation using a simulated WBAN environment demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.

## Related Works

Existing Sybil attack mitigation techniques in IoMT and WBAN environments can be broadly categorized into trust-based, context-aware, cryptographic-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Trust-based methods rely on node behavior and reputation scores but often suffer from bad-mouthing and ballot-stuffing attacks. Context-aware approaches utilize network and physical context information; however, many rely on unrealistic assumptions and lack robust validation.

Cryptographic solutions provide strong identity verification but introduce high computational and energy overhead, making them unsuitable for WBAN devices. Machine learning-based approaches improve adaptability but frequently lack real-time response and self-healing capabilities. The absence of lightweight, adaptive, and autonomous recovery mechanisms highlights a clear research gap, which this project aims to address.

## Methodology

The proposed methodology follows a multi-phase approach:

1. **Literature Review** – Comprehensive analysis of existing Sybil detection techniques in WBAN and IoMT systems.
2. **Dataset Preparation** – Generation of a simulated WBAN dataset containing both normal and Sybil attack scenarios.
3. **ML Model Development** – Design of a lightweight, context-aware machine learning model using network and physiological features.
4. **Self-Healing Mechanism Design** – Development of autonomous recovery strategies including node isolation and credential revocation.
5. **Evaluation** – Performance evaluation based on detection accuracy, false positive rate, energy consumption, and latency.
